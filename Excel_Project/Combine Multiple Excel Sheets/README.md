# 📊 Excel Data Consolidation Using Power Query

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project consolidates data from **multiple Excel workbooks into a single master file** using **Power Query’s Append function**.  
A **folder-based automation** ensures that any new data added to the folder is automatically included in the final dataset upon refresh.

## ✨ Key Features
- ➕ Append multiple Excel files into one table  
- 📁 Folder-based data connection  
- 🔄 Automatic updates when new files are added  
- 🚫 No manual copy-paste required  

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Excel files are stored in a single source folder  
2. Power Query connects to the folder  
3. Data is appended into one consolidated table  
4. Refreshing the query updates the master sheet automatically
