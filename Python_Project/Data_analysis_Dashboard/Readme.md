# 📊 Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python.  
It starts with raw datasets, applies data cleaning and transformation techniques, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and presents insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

# 📁 Dataset

The project uses two CSV files stored inside the `Raw_data/` folder:

- **Details.csv**
- **Orders.csv**

These datasets are merged using common key columns to create a unified dataset for analysis.

# 🔄 Data Processing Workflow

## Data Merging
Both datasets are combined into a single structured dataset to enable comprehensive analysis.

## Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicates  
- Standardizing column names  
- Fixing inconsistent data entries  

## Data Type Conversion
Each column is assigned the appropriate data type:
- Date columns → `datetime`
- Numerical columns → `int` or `float`
- Categorical columns → `category`

This ensures accurate calculations, memory optimization, and reliable analysis.

# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The cleaned dataset is analyzed to extract meaningful insights such as:

- Summary statistics  
- Sales and revenue trends  
- Category-level performance  
- Order distribution patterns  
- Key business performance indicators  

The analysis helps uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights from the data.

# 🖥 Interactive Dashboard

An interactive dashboard is built using Streamlit to visualize the analysis results.

The dashboard enables:

- Dynamic filtering  
- Real-time data exploration  
- KPI monitoring  
- Interactive charts and visual insights  

This allows users to explore the dataset intuitively and make data-driven decisions.
